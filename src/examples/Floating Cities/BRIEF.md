FLOATING CITIES - a browser game through Rhino-Compute

Floating Cities is an interactive browser game, intended for users of all ages.

The rules are as follows. Each movable point forms a building and a ground plane.
Through moving the points in space, different configurations are formed. Depending on the 
distance between these points, stairs appear, the ground planes are joined, or a bigger
building is formed.

This algorithm has been developed first in GH. Through javascript and the three.js library we
are able to vizualize it in a browser. By then hosting it in heroku, a fully functional browser
app is created.

Besides moving the points, the user is able to also control different features
through sliders, changing attraction, densities of the stairs trees and windows.
Through another slider in the header, we are able to change the way the scene is rendered, including or 
excluding the transform controls.

Slider Inputs:

1. Increase Attraction
2. Stair Density
3. Tree Density
4. Window Density Coefficient
5. Window Width Ratio
6. Window Height Ratio

Floating Cities is a project of IAAC, Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia developed in the Master In Advanced Computation For Architecture & Design 2021/2022 by student: Erida Bendo and Faculty: David Andres Leon, Hesham Shawqy
