# FLOATING CITIES - a browser game through Rhino-Compute

Floating Cities is an interactive browser game, intended for users of all ages.

The rules are as follows. Each movable point forms a building and a ground plane. Through moving the points in space, different configurations are formed. Depending on the distance between these points, stairs appear, the ground planes are joined, or a bigger building is formed.

This algorithm has been developed first in GH. Through javascript and the three.js library we are able to vizualize it in a browser. By then hosting it in heroku, a fully functional browser app is created.

Besides moving the points, the user is able to also control different features through sliders, changing attraction, densities of the stairs trees and windows. Through another slider in the header, we are able to change the way the scene is rendered, including or excluding the transform controls.

Slider Inputs:

Increase Attraction
Stair Density
Tree Density
Window Density Coefficient
Window Width Ratio
Window Height Ratio
